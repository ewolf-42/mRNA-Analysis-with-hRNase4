# mRNA-Analysis-with-hRNase4
This folder contains two scripts associated with the paper entitled "Human RNase 4 Improves mRNA Sequence Characterization by LC-MS/MS":

1) "CoverageAnalysisof1000Transcripts.R" - an R script to assess the theoretical coverage of different known site specific endoribonucleases following complete digestion of 1000 random human mRNAs less than 5 kB in length.
2) "OverlapTargetMassWithTranscriptome.R" - an R script to score a deconvoluted mass spectrum against lists of decovoluted RNA oligonucleotide masses derived from a broader database of RNA sequences.
